# GopherTrace
A ray tracer written in the Go language, adapted from the C++ methodologies in the book "Ray tracing in one weekend"

**What is Ray Tracing?**

Ray tracing is a technique in computer graphics for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.

**Objectives of this project**

- To explore the field of Computer Graphics through a hands-on project
- To master the fundamentals Go programming by emulating C++ code, a language which I am more familiar with.
- Make something that looks cool!

# How to run it

`<go run *.go>`

The file returned is a .ppm file, which can be viewed using ToyViewer for OS X, or some other software on other systems (haven't looked into it).
